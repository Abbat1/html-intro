    <h2>Intro #1</h2>
    <ol><p>  Hello everybody, hopefully we all are reading this message in the morning preparing for the day
        of learning ahead of us. As we all know some of us may be new to this, while others may have previous 
        experience. We ask that we all encourage each other and give CONSTRUCTIVE criticism to others, leaving them comfortable
        with learning and correcting mistakes. Well, nice talk Mate. We'll speak later on.
    </p></ol>
    <ol><h2>Intro #2</h2>

        72 degrees. The spring time is finally here. About time won't you say lol. I had some really good 
        yesterday and i've been feening for another cup since. That's the end of my rant.
